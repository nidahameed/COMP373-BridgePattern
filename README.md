## Summary
We created a simple bakery with an output that confirms a production and decoration of pastries. We implemented an interface (Bakery.java) as the implementor, with two classes (Bake.java, and Decorate.java) as concrete implementors. Then, we used the Pastry.java class as the abstraction, and the two classes, Cookie.java and Cake.java, for refined abstraction.
